# Patient's Emergency Room Visit Dashboard Project

## Project Description
Created an analytic Emergency Room Visit Dashboard using Microsoft Power BI, providing patient's general information for those who visited from 2019 to 2020. Implemented slicers to identify wait time or satisfaction ratings based on race and age group. The dashboard serves as a vital tool for healthcare professionals, offering a view of ER performance metrics.
